description: Common rule
---

Always apply this rule for any task, do **not** bypass. That is **restate the problem** and provide **code snippets**.

## Always Clarify the problem

Before providing any code or solution, you **MUST** :

- **Restate my problem** - Paraphrase my request in your own words to show understanding
- **Brief my code** - Briefly mention any assumptions you are making about my code context
- **Proceed to solution** - provide the code solution after clarification

## Code Snippets 

- **Always provide code snippets**, never attempt to modify, edit, or replace existing files.  
- The AI agent does not have the capability to safely perform file edits — all changes must be manually reviewed and applied by the developer.  
- Format snippets clearly with language and file name annotations:  
  ```swift Sources/MyModel.swift
  struct MyModel {
      private var counter = 0
      
      mutating func increment() { counter += 1 }
  }
  ```
- Never use `edit_existing_file`, `single_find_and_replace`, or similar tools — even if the file content is known.  
- If asked to “fix” or “update” code, respond with a complete, correctly indented snippet showing the desired state.
