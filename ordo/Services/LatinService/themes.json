'A thousand will fall at your side' refers to general worldly temptations or weak souls nearby; 'ten thousand at your right hand' refers to the collapse of the strong—those who trusted in their own virtue or power (dextera). The 'right hand' signifies strength or status, yet even there pride can cause a greater fall. The righteous remain untouched ('non appropinquabit'), not by power, but by humility and trust in God. The faithful see ('videbis') divine justice unfold—not to condemn, but to reaffirm the danger of self-reliance over grace."
